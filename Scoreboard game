# Welcome to the Python coding playground
# You're making a simple game scoreboard!
# Tasks:
# - Create an array of player scores
# - Add new scores as players join
# - Remove scores when players leave
# - Split players into two teams

import numpy as np

# insert a new score after the 2nd score
scores = np.array([85, 92, 78, 90])
new = np.insert(scores,2,90)# Finish this line
print("After inserting new score:",new)

# Remove the 3rd score
updated = np.delete(scores,2)# Finish this line
print("After deleting a score:",updated)

# Create a 2d array with the updated scores across levels
scores_across_levels = np.array([updated, updated])
print("Scores Across level:",scores_across_levels)

# Remove the scores from the bottom level
without_bottom_level = scores_across_levels[0]# Finish this line
print("Scores without bottom level:",without_bottom_level)
