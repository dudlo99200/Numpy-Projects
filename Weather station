# Welcome to the Python coding playground
# You're a meteorologist analyzing this week's temperature data!

import numpy as np

# Last week's temperatures (°C)
last_week = np.array([20, 21, 19, 22, 23, 1, 20])



# 2. Calculate average
average =np.mean(last_week)
print("Average Temp:",average)



# 3. Find temperature extremes
hottest = np.max(last_week) # 
coldest = np.min(last_week) # 
print("Hottest Temp:",hottest)
print("Coldest Temp:",coldest)



# 4. Compare weeks
# Current week's temperature (°C)
current_week = np.array([19,25,18,17,5,6,2])
temp_difference = last_week - current_week 
print("Temperature Difference:",temp_difference)



# 5. Find temperature range (max - min)
range = hottest - coldest
print("Temperature Range:",range)


# 6. Calculate day-by-day differences
difference = np.diff(last_week)
print("Day by Day Temp difference:",difference)


# 7. Find days above average
above_avg = last_week[last_week > average]
print("Above Average Temperature:",above_avg)
